# Turabian Style Paper.dotm

This Microsoft Word template (.dotm) provides a research paper formatted based on the 9th edition of Kate L. Turabian’s *A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations: Chicago Style for Students and Researchers*.

## About the Formatting and Styles

### General Formatting
The provided research paper has a default page size set to 8.5 x 11 inches (US Letter). Page margins are each set 1 inch from the edge of the paper.

Pages are numbered with arabic numerals and are placed on the right-side of the header. Page numbering begins after a section break that separates the title page from the main text (Turabian, *A Manual for Writers*, 384-386).

The default font typeface is set to Times New Roman with a 12-point font size. Text is double-spaced throughout the document, except where single-spacing is specified by Turabian’s manual (e.g. block quotations, table titles and figure captions, footnotes, endnotes, and items in a bibliography/references list). Automated hyphenation is turned off and text, where not centered, is left-aligned (385, 416).

Paragraphs, within the body of the text, use the `Normal` paragraph style -- a paragraph style that is 12-pt Times New Roman, double-spaced, and has a first-line indentation of 0.5 inches.

### Headings for Sections and Subsections

Headings are used to divide the main text into sections and subsections. The heading styles are as follows:
  * `Heading 1` => Section (Level 1)
  * `Heading 2` => Subsection (Level 2)
  * `Heading 3` => Subsection (Level 3)
  * `Heading 4` => Subsection (Level 4)

The `Heading 1 New Page` style is based on the `Heading 1` style but also provides: (1) a page break before the section heading; and (2) additional spacing after the heading. This style is useful for specific section headings such as *Introduction*, *Appendix*, and *Bibliography*.

### Additional Paragraph Styles

`Quotation Block` is for typesetting block quotations. Text uses "single-space" and leaves "a blank line before and after it." The entire block quotation is indented 0.5 inches from the left margin (361).

`Table Title` is for table captions. This style is based on the `Caption` style but provides additional spacing between the title of the table and the previous text. The title is also kept with the proceeding table.

`Figure Caption` is for figure captions. This style is also based on the `Caption` style but provides additional spacing after the figure caption.

`Footnote Text` is for text within footnotes. This style is single-spaced and has a 10-point font size. Footnotes are separated from one-another by a single-line space. Additional paragraphs, within a footnote, are formatted using the `Footnote Text Paragraph` style.

`Endnote Text` is for typesetting text in endnotes. Endnote text is single-spaced and uses a 12-point font size. Endnotes are separated from one-another by a single-line space. Additional paragraphs, within an endnote, are formatted using the `Endnote Text Paragraph` style.

`Bibliography` is for the text of each entry of the Bibliography (or References list when using the Author-Date citation style).

### A Note on Footnotes and Endnotes

When endnotes are set to "End of section," inserting a section break before the Bibliography or References list will allow the Notes to be placed *before* the Bibliography or References list. If endnotes are being used for source citations, and footnotes for "substantive comments," footnote references need to be, instead, labelled using "symbols". Footnote references are then restarted on each page (161).

Although the reference number within the text of each note is preferably "formatted as regular text" followed by a period and space, Turabian’s manual allows for notes to use superscript (without the following period) provided that "local guidelines allow it" (162).
